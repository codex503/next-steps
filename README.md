# Next Steps

We have all been there. That one job that really sucks. You want to get out and find something that makes you happy but you dont know where to start. So you google around till you realize that coding is a possible option. Why shouldnt it be? Its an industry based on merit, that anyone can do. Be determined enough, and you can help grow the ranks of developers. This document will be the start of that. 

## What is covered here

* What languages are out there
* Where to learn
* What you need for any specific language
* Projects that you can build
 
From this, you will have a good baseline to get started. You will stumble, you will fail, you will get stumped and need a break. But at the same time, if you keep pushing, you will be challenging yourself with a great endeavour. It can not be understated how intense this will be. Coding is NOT easy. Being a developer isnt easy. Everyday has a new challenge.
